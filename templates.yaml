    Welcome to the Alexa Skills Kit sample. We're going to practice mimicking
    each other. You'll repeat the words I say by responding with,
    the word you said was red.

welcome_reprompt: Would you like to start a new round? Please say yes or no.

correct_response: |
    That's right, the word was {{ actual_answer }}.

incorrect_response: |
    Sorry, the word was {{ actual_answer }}.

correct_response_reprompt: You can ask me for another word by saying, what's another word?

known_answer_bye: That word was {{ answer }}. Goodbye

unknown_answer: I'm not sure what that word is, please try again

unknown_answer_reprompt: |
    I'm not sure what that word is. You can tell me that word again by saying,
    the word you said was red

no_text: |
    Goodbye.

yes_text: |
    Repeat after me. The word is {{ actual_answer }}.
